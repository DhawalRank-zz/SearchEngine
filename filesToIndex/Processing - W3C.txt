This is sometimes calledthe XML Promise.However, it is often useful to be able to suggest how aparticular document might be processed. The XProc specificationprovides a way to do that:XProc: An XML Pipeline Language is an XML-basedlanguage for describing operations to be performed on XML documents.Note that there is no single processingmodel for all XML Documents, and there is nodefault processing model. XProc (XML Pipeline) is one exampleof a way to say how to process an XML document. You can alsohave multiple XML Pipelines that you might select from toprocess a given document.What is XProc Used For?Use XProc to say that a particular document or set of documentsshould be processed in a certain order: for example, first XInclude andthen XSD Schema validation, and then XSLT with a particular XSL stylesheet.Examples<pipeline xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"><xinclude/><validate-with-xml-schema><input port="schema"><document href="http://example.com/path/to/schema.xsd"/></input></validate-with-xml-schema><xslt><input port="stylesheet"><document href="http://example.com/path/to/stylesheet.xsl"/></input></xslt></pipeline>This example indicates that a document with which thispipeline is associated shouldfirst have XInclude processing done on it,then be validated with a specific schema,and finally have an XSLT stylesheet applied tothe result of validation.Learn More...Explanation...*-->Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:XML Pipeline (XProc)XIncludeThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:XML Processing Model Working GroupXML Core Working GroupContact: Liam R.
