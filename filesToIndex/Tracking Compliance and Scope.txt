ScopeDo Not Track is designed to provide users with a simple preference expressionmechanism to allow or limit online tracking globally or selectively.The specification applies to compliance with requests through user agentsthat (1) can access the general browsable Web; (2) have a user interface thatsatisfies the requirements in Determining User Preference in the [TRACKING-DNT] specification; (3) and can implement all of the [TRACKING-DNT] specification, including the mechanisms for communicating a tracking status, and the user-granted exception mechanism.Issue 209: Description of scope of specification2. Definitions2.1 UserA user is an individual human. When user agent softwareaccesses online resources, whether or not the user understands or hasspecific knowledge of a particular request, that request is "made bythe user."2.2 User AgentThe term user agent refers to any of thevarious client programs capable of initiating HTTP requests,including but not limited to browsers, spiders (web-based robots),command-line tools, native applications, and mobile apps [HTTP11].2.3 Network InteractionA network interaction is a single HTTP request and itscorresponding response(s): zero or more interim (1xx) responses anda single final (2xx-5xx) response.2.4 User ActionA user action is a deliberate action by the user, viaconfiguration, invocation, or selection, to initiate a networkinteraction. Selection of a link, submission of a form, and reloadinga page are examples of user actions.2.5 SubrequestA subrequest is any network interaction that is not directlyinitiated by user action. For example, an initial response in a hypermediaformat that contains embedded references to stylesheets, images, framesources, and onload actions will cause a browser, depending on itscapabilities and configuration, to perform a corresponding set of automatedsubrequests to fetch those references using additional network interactions.2.6 PartyA party is a natural person, a legal entity, or a setof legal entities that share common owner(s), common controller(s),and a group identity that is easily discoverable by a user. Commonbranding or providing a list of affiliates that is available via alink from a resource where a party describes DNT practices are examplesof ways to provide this discoverability.2.7 Service ProviderAn outsourced service provider is considered to be thesame party as its client if the service provider:acts only as a data processor on behalf of the client;ensures that the data can only be accessed and used as directedby that client;has no independent right to use or share the data except asnecessary to ensure the integrity, security, and correct operationof the service being provided; andhas a contract in place that outlines and mandates theserequirements.Issue 206: Service Provider name and requirements2.8 First PartyWith respect to a given user action, a first partyis a party with which the user intends to interact, via one or morenetwork interactions, as a result of making that action. Merelyhovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of contentdoes not constitute a user's intent to interact with another party.In some cases, a resource on the Web will be jointly controlled bytwo or more distinct parties. Each of those parties is considered afirst party if a user would reasonably expect to communicate withall of them when accessing that resource. For example, prominentco-branding on the resource might lead a user to expect thatmultiple parties are responsible for the content or functionality.2.9 Third PartyFor any data collected as a result of one or more network interactionsresulting from a user's action, a third party is any partyother than that user, a first party for that user action, or a serviceprovider acting on behalf of either that user or that first party.2.10 DeidentifiedData is deidentified when a party:has achieved a reasonable level of justified confidence that thedata cannot be used to infer information about, or otherwise belinked to, a particular consumer, computer, or other device;commits to make no attempt to re-identify the data; andcontractually prohibits downstream recipients from attempting tore-identify the data.Issue 188: Definition of de-identified (or previously, unlinkable) data2.11 TrackingTracking is the collection of data regarding a particularuser's activity across multiple distinct contexts and the retention,use, or sharing of data derived from that activity outside thecontext in which it occurred.A context is a set of resources that are controlled bythe same party or jointly controlled by a set of parties.2.12 Collect, Use, Share, FacilitateA party collects data received in a network interaction if that dataremains within the partyâ€™s control after the network interaction is complete.A party uses data if the party processes the data for any purposeother than storage or merely forwarding it to another party.A party shares data if it transfers or provides a copy of data toany other party.A party facilitates any other partyâ€™s collection of data if it enablessuch party to collect data and engage in tracking.2.13 Graduated ResponseA graduated response a methodology where the action taken is proportional to the size of the problem or risk that is trying to be mitigated. In the context of this document, the term is used to describe an increase in the collection of data about a user or interaction in response to a specific problem that a party has become aware of, such as an increase in fraudulent activity originating from a particular network or IP address range resulting in increased logging of data relating to interactions from that specific range of IP addresses as opposed to increased logging for all users in general.NoteOnly used in security, below, and may overlap with the explanationthere. Delete the definition and let it be defined the only placeit's used?3. User Agent ComplianceIssue 205: user agent compliance requirements; connections to TPENote Much of this is duplicative of requirements in the [TRACKING-DNT] specification. Can we harmonize the two? For example: by removing this section and just including a normative reference and a summary of the requirements; or by reducing this section to any requirements beyond those in [TRACKING-DNT].A user agent MUST offer users a minimum of two alternative choices for a Do Not Track general preference: unset or DNT: 1. A user agent MAY offer a third alternative choice: DNT: 0.If the user's choice is DNT:1 or DNT:0, the tracking preference is enabled; otherwise, the tracking preference is not enabled.A user agent MUST have a default tracking preference of unset (not enabled).User agents and web sites are responsible for determining the user experience by which a tracking preference is controlled. User agents and web sites MUST ensure that tracking preference choices are communicated to users clearly and accurately and shown at the time and place the tracking preference choice is made available to a user. User agents and web sites MUST ensure that the tracking preference choices describe the parties to whom DNT applies and MUST make available brief and neutral explanatory text to provide more detailed information about DNT functionality.That text MUST indicate that:if the tracking preference is communicated, it limits collection and use of web viewing data for certain advertising and other purposes;when DNT is enabled, some data may still be collected and used for certain purposes, and a description of such purposes; andif a user affirmatively allows a particular party to collect and use data about web viewing activities, enabling DNT will not limit collection and use from that party.User agents and web sites MUST obtain an explicit choice made by a user when setting controls that affect the tracking preference expression.A user agent MUST transmit the tracking preference according to the [TRACKING-DNT] specification.Implementations of HTTP that are not under control of the user MUST NOT generate or modify a tracking preference.4. First Party ComplianceWith respect to a given user action, a first party to that action which receives a DNT:1 signal MAY collect and use data received from those network interactions. This includes customizing content, services and advertising with respect to those user actions.A first party to a given user action MUST NOT share data about those network interactions with third parties to that action who are prohibited from collecting data from those network interactions under this recommendation. Data about the interaction MAY be shared withh service providers acting on behalf of the first party.A first party to a given user action MAY elect to follow the rules defined under this recommendation for third parties.Note Given WG decision on ISSUE-241, how should a first party to an action indicate to the user that it is electing to follow third-party rules? Should we suggest using "N" or some other tracking status code?Issue 170: Definition of and what/whether limitations around data append and first parties5. Third Party ComplianceIssue 203: Use of 'tracking' in third-party complianceWhen a third party to a given user action receives a DNT:1 signal in a related network interaction:that party MUST NOT collect, share, or use datarelated to that interaction;that party MUST NOT use data about previous networkinteractions in which it was a third party.A third party to a given user action MAY nevertheless collect and use suchdata when:a user has explicitly-granted an exception, as described below;data is collected for the set of permitted uses described below;or, the data is de-identified as defined in this recommendation.Outside the permitted uses and explicitly-granted exceptions listed below,a third party to a given user action MUST collect, share, or associate with relatednetwork interactions any identifiers that identify a specific user, user agent, or device.For example, a third party that does not require unique user identifiers forone of the permitted uses MUST NOT place a unique identifier in cookiesor other browser-based local storage mechanisms.A third party to a given user action that disregards a DNT signal MUST indicate so to the useragent, using the response mechanism defined in the [TRACKING-DNT] recommendation.It is outside the scope of this specification to control short-term,transient collection and use of data, so long as the data is notshared with a third party and is not used to build a profile about auser or otherwise alter an individual userâ€™s user experience outside thecurrent network interaction. For example, the contextual customizationof ads shown as part of the same network interaction is not restrictedby a DNT:1 signal.Issue 134: Would we additionally permit logs that are retained for a short enough period?Issue 204: Definitions of collection / retention and transience / network interaction5.1 Third Party Geolocation ComplianceIf a third party to a given user action receives aDNT:1 signal in a related network interaction, then thatparty MUST NOT use geolocation data in that interaction at any level moregranular than postal code, unless specific consent has been grantedfor the use of more granular location data.Issue 202: Limitations on geolocation by third parties5.2 General Principles for Permitted UsesSome collection and use of data by third parties to a given user action is permitted,notwithstanding receipt of DNT:1 in a network interaction, as enumerated below.Different permitteduses may differ in their permitted items of data collection,retention times, and consequences. In all cases, collection and use of data must be reasonablynecessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which it is specificallypermitted; unreasonable or disproportionate collection, retention,or use are not â€œpermitted usesâ€?.5.2.1 No Secondary UsesA party MUST NOT use data collected for permitted uses forpurposes other than the permitted uses for which each datum waspermitted to be collected.5.2.2 Data Minimization, Retention and TransparencyData collected by a party for permitted uses MUST be limited tothe data reasonably necessary for such permitted uses. Such dataMUST NOT be retained any longer than is proportionate to andreasonably necessary for such permitted uses.A party MUST provide public transparency of the time periodsfor which data collected for permitted uses are retained. Theparty MAY enumerate different retention periods fordifferent permitted uses. Data MUST NOT be used for a permitteduse once the data retention period for that permitted use hasexpired. After there are no remaining permitted uses for givendata, the data MUST be deleted or de-identified.A party that collects data for a permitted use MUST make reasonable data minimization efforts to ensure that only the data necessary for the permitted use is retained, and MUST NOT rely on unique identifiers if alternative solutions are reasonably available.Issue 199: Limitations on the use of unique identifiersIssue 233: Data Minimization, Retention and Transparency Should we use "minimized" rather than "limited" in this section?5.2.3 No PersonalizationA party that collects data for a permitted use MUST NOT use that data to alter aspecific user's online experience based on multi-site activity,except as specifically permitted below.5.2.4 Reasonable SecurityA party that collects data for a permitted use MUST use reasonable technical and organizationalsafeguards to prevent further processing of data retained forpermitted uses. While physical separation of data maintained forpermitted uses is not required, best practices SHOULD be in placeto ensure technical controls ensure access limitations andinformation security. That party SHOULD ensure that the accessand use of data retained for permitted uses is auditable.5.3 Permitted UsesIssue 211: Should we specify retention periods (extended with transparency) for permitted uses?5.3.1 Frequency CappingRegardless of the tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collected, retained and used to limitthe number of times that a user sees a particular advertisement, often calledfrequency capping, as long as the data retained do not reveal the userâ€™sbrowsing history. A party MUST NOT construct profiles of users or user behaviors basedon their ad frequency history, or otherwise alter the userâ€™s experience.5.3.2 Financial LoggingRegardless of the tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collected and used forbilling and auditing related to the current network interaction andconcurrent transactions. This may include counting ad impressions to unique visitors,verifying positioning and quality of ad impressions and auditing compliance with thisand other standards.5.3.3 SecurityRegardless of the tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collectedand used to the extent reasonably necessary to detect securityincidents, protect the service against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent,or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for such activity,provided that such data is not used for operational behavior(profiling or personalization) beyond what is reasonably necessaryto protect the service or institute a graduated response.When feasible, a graduated response to a detected security incidentis preferred over widespread data collection. An example would be recordingall use from a given IP address range, regardless of DNT signal, if theparty believes it is seeing a coordinated attack on its service (such asclick fraud) from that IP address range. Similarly, if an attack sharedsome other identifiable fingerprint, such as a combination of User Agentand other protocol information, the party could retain logs on allinteractions matching that fingerprint until it can be determined thatthey are not associated with such an attack or such retention is nolonger necessary to support prosecution.5.3.4 DebuggingRegardless of the tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collected, retained and used fordebugging purposes to identify and repair errors that impair existing intendedfunctionality.5.3.5 Audience MeasurementNoteNote: An open question for the group is whether or how audience measurement would be addressed; see issue 25.Issue 25: How is audience measurement adressed under DNT? (permitted use or otherwise)6. User-Granted ExceptionsWhen a user sends a DNT:0 signal, the user is expressing a preferencefor a personalized experience. This signal indicates explicit consentfor data collection, retention, processing, disclosure, and use by therecipient of this signal to provide a personalized experience for theuser. This recommendation places no restrictions on data collectedfrom requests received with DNT:0.A party MAY engage in practices otherwise proscribedby this recommendation if the user has given explicit and informed consent.This consent MAY be obtained through the API defined in thecompanion [TRACKING-DNT] document, or a party MAYobtain out of band consent to disregard a Do Not Trackpreference using a different technology. If a party is relying onout of band consent to disregard a Do Not Track preference, theparty MUST indicate this consent to the user agent as described inthe companion [TRACKING-DNT] document.7. Interaction with Existing User Privacy ControlsMultiple systems may be setting, sending, and receiving DNT and/oropt-out signals at the same time. As a result, it will be important toensure industry and web browser vendors are on the same page withrespect to honoring user choices in circumstances where "mixedsignals" may be received.As a general principle, more specific settings override lessspecific settings.No DNT Signal / No Opt-Out: Treat as DNT unsetDNT:1 Signal / No Opt-Out: Treat as DNT: 1Opt-Out / No DNT:1 Signal: Treat as DNT: 1Opt-Out / DNT User-Granted Exception: Treat as DNT: 0 for thatsite; DNT User-Granted Exception is honoredIssue 210: Interaction with existing privacy controlsIssue 207: Conditions for dis-regarding (or not) DNT signals8. Unknowing CollectionIf a party learns that it possesses data in violation of this recommendation, it MUST, where reasonably feasible, delete or de-identify that data at the earliest practical opportunity, even if it was previously unaware of such information practices despite reasonable efforts to understand its information practices.Issue 208: Requirements on unknowing collection, retention and use9. Legal ComplianceNotwithstanding anything in this recommendation, a party MAY collect, use, and share data required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and judicial processes.A.
