HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the(visual and aural) layout, for avariety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSSare the basis of building Web pages andWebApplications. Learn more belowabout:What is HTML?HTML is the languagefor describing the structure of Webpages. HTML gives authors the means to:Publish online documents with headings,text, tables, lists, photos, etc.Retrieve online information viahypertext links, at the click of abutton.Design forms for conducting transactionswith remote services, for use insearching for information, makingreservations, ordering products, etc.Include spread-sheets, video clips,sound clips, and other applicationsdirectly in their documents.With HTML, authors describe the structureof pages using markup. Theelements of the language labelpieces of content such as “paragraph,”“list,” “table,” and so on.What is XHTML?XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses thesyntax of XML,the Extensible Markup Language. XHTML hasall the same elements (for paragraphs,etc.) as the HTML variant, but the syntaxis slightly different. Because XHTML is anXML application, you can use other XMLtools with it (such as XSLT, alanguage for transforming XML content).What is CSS?CSS is thelanguage for describing the presentation ofWeb pages, including colors, layout, andfonts. It allows one to adapt the presentationto different types of devices, such aslarge screens, small screens, orprinters. CSS is independent of HTML andcan be used with any XML-based markuplanguage. The separation of HTML from CSSmakes it easier to maintain sites, sharestyle sheets across pages, and tailor pagesto different environments. This is referredto as the separation of structure (or:content) from presentation.What is WebFonts?WebFonts is a technology that enables people to use fonts on demand over the Web without requiring installation in the operating system. W3C has experience in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Until recently, downloadable fonts have not been common on the Web due to the lack of aninteroperable font format. The WebFonts effort plans to address that through the creation of an industry-supported, open font format for the Web (called "WOFF").ExamplesThe following very simple example of aportion of an HTML document illustrates howto create a link within a paragraph. Whenrendered on the screen (or by a speechsynthesizer), the link text will be “finalreport”; when somebody activates the link,the browser will retrieve the resourceidentified by“http://www.example.com/report”:<p class="moreinfo">For more information see the<a href="http://www.example.com/report">final report</a>.</p>The class attribute on theparagraph's start tag (“<p>”) can beused, among other thing, to add style. Forinstance, to italicize the text of allparagraphs with a class of “moreinfo,” onecould write, in CSS:p.moreinfo { font-style: italic }By placing that rule in a separate file,the style may be shared by any number ofHTML documents.More InformationFor more information about HTML and CSS,see tutorials for HTML and CSS.For advanced document transformations andlayout beyond CSS, see XSLT& XSL-FO.Recent W3C Press Releases and Member TestimonialsHTML5 Definition Complete, W3C Moves to Interoperability Testing and Performance17 December 2012Recent Press18 JuneKnight Blog“The World Wide Web Consortium at 20: Moving the Web toward its ‘full potential’”18 JuneZDNet“HTML5 : le W3C devrait finaliser la spécification avant la fin de l’année”17 JuneRedmond Magazine“HTML5 on Track for W3C Finalization by Year's End”13 JuneLaboratory Equipment“Tech Lets You Track Your Data Online ”Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:HTMLCSSBest Practices for Authoring HTMLWeb FontsDigital PublishingThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working GroupHTML Working GroupDevice APIs Working GroupForms Working GroupInternationalization Working GroupMath Working GroupProtocols and Formats Working GroupRDFa Working GroupSVG Working GroupTechnical Architecture GroupWeb Applications Working GroupWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines Working GroupWebFonts Working GroupXML Core Working GroupXSLT Working GroupCurrent StatusHTMLCSSBest Practices for Authoring HTMLWeb FontsDigital PublishingUse ItTutorialsCSS SoftwareXHTML 1.0 Strict cheat sheetXHTML Basic 1.1 cheat sheetW3C cheat sheetRecommended Doctype DeclarationsValidatorsMarkupCSSLogosHTMLCSSFooter NavigationNavigationHomeStandardsParticipateMembershipAbout W3CContact W3CContactHelp and FAQSponsor / DonateSite MapFeedbackW3C UpdatesCopyright © 2013 W3C ® (MIT,ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.////]]>
