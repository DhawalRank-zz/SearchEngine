URL, URI, IRI is the way toname things on the Web and manipulate them. Some additionaladdressing needs in the Web Services stack motivated someadditional layers.ProtocolsProtocols are the vehicle for exchanging our ideas.HTTP is the core protocol of the Web. W3C is alsoworking on XML Protocols and SOAP in relation to WebServices.Meta FormatsXML, the Extensible Markup Language, is used to buildnew formats at low cost (due to widely available toolsto manipulate content in those new formats). RDF and OWLallow people to define vocabularies (“ontologies”) ofterms as part of the Semantic Web.Protocol and Meta Format ConsiderationsDocuments on the Web are loosely joined pieces byidentifiers. It creates a maze of rich interactions betweenprotocols and formats.InternationalizationW3C has worked with the community on the internationalizationof identifiers (IRIs) and a general character model for theWeb.NewsAnnouncing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.017 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebArchitectureVersion 7.0of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 newcharacters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols forthe Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-usedand historic scripts, as well as character additions to manyexisting scripts. These additions extend support for writtenlanguages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,and Africa. See the link above for full details. Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters inlong-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdingsfonts. Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. Newproperty values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach torendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joiningbehavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of thesyllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can besignificantly improved. Unicode character properties were extended to the newcharacters. The old characters have enhancements to Script andAlphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. Therewere also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as wellas new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperableimplementations. Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained insynchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version7.0. These will be released at the same time:UTS #10,Unicode Collation Algorithm— the standard for sorting UnicodetextUTS #46,Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing— for processing ofnon-ASCII URLs (IDNs)Last Call draft published for Encoding spec06 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebArchitectureA Last Call Working Draft ofEncodinghas been published. While encodings have been defined to some extent,implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealingwith undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. Thisspecification attempts to fill those gaps so that newimplementations do not have to reverse engineer encodingimplementations of the market leaders and existing implementationscan converge. The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version asof the date of its publication, intended to provide a stablereference for other specifications. We are hoping for people toreview the specification and send comments about any technicalareas that need attention (see the Status section for details). Please send comments by1 July 2014.Capability URLs: We Need Your Feedback22 May2014fromW3C TAGLinesThe battle for web security and privacy is fought at manylevels. Sometimes common practice in web application design canlead to data leakage with untended consequences for users. A goodexample of this came up recently where confidential files sharedthrough common web-based document sharing services were beingexposed unintentionaly to third parties because the private URLsused to share them had been unintentionally leaked.Dropbox and Box Leaked Shared Private Files Through Googlehttp://t.co/hvuSel9Xvzv/@slashdot [ cfhttp://t.co/Mjhp7hsstd/cc@JeniT]— Daniel Appelquist (@torgo)May7, 2014URLs that allow a user to access an otherwise privilegedresource or information are called Capability URLs, and while they can be powerful, theycan also cause potential problems when used improperly. TAG member Jeni Tennison has been working on a draft definingthe space of capability URLs and outlining some good practices forusage. We think this document should be useful for web builders whoare thinking about incorporating this pattern into theirapplications. We think it’s pretty good, but we need your feedbackbefore we finalize it and release it as a TAG finding. The draft may be found here:http://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/ and if you have feedbackyou are encouraged to raise an issueon github ore-mail us on theTAG publicmailing list. Thanks!New version of Unicode Ideographic Variation Database released19 May2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebArchitectureThe Unicode Consortium is pleased to announce the release ofversion 2014-05-16 of the Unicode Ideographic Variation Database(IVD). This release registers the new Moji_Joho collection, alongwith the first 10,710 sequences in that collection, 9,685 of whichare shared by the registered Hanyo-Denshi collection. Details canbe found at http://www.unicode.org/ivd/.Slides for the MultilingualWeb and LIDER workshops available15 May2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebArchitectureThe slides from theMultilingualWeb workshop (including several posters) and theLIDER roadmapping workshopare now available for download.Additional material (videos of the presentations, a workshop reportand more) will follow in the next weeks – stay tuned.Extensible Web Summit Roundup17 April2014fromW3C TAGLinesOn April 4th, with the much-appreciated help and support of AdobeSystems, the TAG organized an event in San Francisco called theExtensible Web Summit. AsI wrote before the event, the intention was to bringtogether web developers and web platform developers from the localarea to discuss upcoming, in-development web platform technologiesand standards both to throw a spotlight on some of the topics wethink are key and to guide the TAG’s thinking. Judgingfrom the feedback we’ve received, I we achieved these goals andmore. There were quite a few positive views shared on Twitter,including:Epic day at the#ExtWebSummit. Devs, standards, and implementors all workingtogether.

Sheis followed by a strong line up in sessions entitled Developers,Creators, Localizers, Machines, and Users, including speakers fromMicrosoft, Wikimedia Foundation, the UN FAO, W3C, Yandex, SDL,Lionbridge, Asia Pacific TLD, Verisign, DFKI, and many more. On theafternoon of the second day we will hold Open Space breakoutdiscussions. Abstracts and details about an additional postersession will be provided shortly. The program will also feature anLD4LT event on May 8-9, focusing on text analytics and theusefulness of Wikipedia and Dbpedia for multiilngual text andcontent analytics, and on language resources and aspects ofconverting selected types of language resources into RDF. Participation in both events is free. See theCall for Participation for details about how to register for theMultilingualWeb workshop. The LD4LT event requires aseparate registrationand you have the opportunity to submitposition statements about language resources and RDF. If you haven’t registered yet, note that space is limited, soplease be sure to register soon to ensure that you get a place. The MultilingualWeb workshops, funded by the European Commissionand coordinated by the W3C, look at best practices and standardsrelated to all aspects of creating, localizing and deploying themultilingual Web. The workshops are successful because they attracta wide range of participants, from fields such as localization,language technology, browser development, content authoring andtool development, etc., to create a holistic view of theinteroperability needs of the multilingual Web. We look forward to seeing you in Madrid!The Extensible Web Summit17 March2014fromW3C TAGLinesWe’re running an event on Friday the 4thof April in San Francisco and you’re invited. For the past year, along-side our regular face-to-face meetings,the TAG has been holding evening developer meet-ups under themoniker “Meet the TAG.” The radical idea has been to take advantageof the fact that our meetings are happening in cities with largeconcentrations of Web developers to connect with these developercommunities in a meaningful and useful way. The hopeful outcome isto both keep developers informed about what we’re doing, presumablyon their behalf, with their platform, and to drive somefeedback back into the TAG to help guide our thinking and our work.The results have generally been good, generating useful criticism andfeedbackwhich we’ve tried to take on board, and making the TAGless of an echo chamber. In the mean time we’ve met lots ofdevelopers who take a keen interest in web architecture and thefuture of the web platform. For our next face-to-face meeting in San Francisco, we’replanning to expand this idea to a full-fledged one-day event,bringing in web developers and webplatformdevelopers, people who are deeply invested in theweb platform but may not be participating directly in standards.We’re calling this event theExtensible Web Summit. As Twitter denizen Daniel Buchner put it:@briankardell @wycats @w3ctag are youtelling me we’re going to try developing API “products” usingdirect “customer” feedback? Mind = blown — Daniel Buchner (@csuwildcat) December 9, 2013 The web is 25 years old. What do we want this platform to looklike 25 years from now? This event will bring together web platformdevelopers and practitioners from different communities andbackgrounds to focus on the future of the web architecture andplatform. With the exception of some curated lightning talks at thebeginning of the day to set the scene, the event will be run as anunconference, with the agenda self-organized by theparticipants. We’d like to thank Adobe Systems for steppingforward as our host for this event. Who should attend? We would ideally like to pack this event withplatform developers, framework developers and web developers withan interest in helping to drive the future of the web platform. Ifyou read and liked what you saw in the Extensible WebManifesto  and you’d like to learn more and influence thedirection of this thinking, then we’d love to have you along.Likewise if you are interested in other web technologies such asreal time communication, platform & device APIs, security,permissions, manifests & packaging, offline usage, JavaScriptpromises & streams, push notifications and touch. The event isfree to attend, but is filling up fast.

With over 30 million articles in 286 languagesas ofJanuary 1, 2014, Wikipedia has now become one of the largestproviders of multilingual content in the world. Because of itsuser-generated and constantly changing content, many traditionalprocesses for managing multilingual content on the web either donot work or do not scale well for Wikipedia. Alolita Sharma’skeynote will highlight Wikipedia’s diversity in multilingualuser-generated content and the language technologies that Wikipediahas had to develop to support its unprecedented growth of content.She will also discuss the many challenges Wikipedia faces inproviding language support for the mobile web. The Multilingual Web Workshop series brings togetherparticipants interested in the best practices, new technologies,and standards needed to help content creators, localizers, languagetools developers, and others address the new opportunities andchallenges of the multilingual Web. It will provide for networkingacross communities and building connections. Registration for the Workshop is free, andearlyregistrationis recommended since space at the Workshop islimited. There is still opportunity for individuals to submit proposalsto speak at the workshop. Ideal proposals will highlight emergingchallenges or novel solutions for reaching out to a global,multilingual audience. The deadline for speaker proposals is March14, but early submission is strongly encouraged. See theCall for Participationfor more details. This workshop is made possible by the generous support of theLIDER project, which will organize a roadmapping workshop on linkeddata and content analytics as one of the tracks at Multilingual WebWorkshop.Talks and AppearancesNone.
