On the Semantic Web, data is modeled as aset of (named) relationships between resources. Inference means thatautomatic procedures can generate new relationships based on the dataand based on some additional information in the form of a vocabulary, e.g., aset of rules. Whether the new relationships are explicitly added to theset of data, or are returned at query time, is an implementationissue.On the Semantic Web, the source of such extra information can be definedvia vocabularies or rule sets. Both of these approaches drawupon knowledge representation techniques. Ingeneral, ontologies concentrate on classification methods, putting anemphasis on defining 'classes', 'subclasses', on how individualresources can be associated to such classes, and characterizing therelationships among classes and their instances. Rules, on the otherhand, concentrate on defining a general mechanism on discovering andgenerating new relationships based on existing ones, much like logicprograms, like Prolog, do. In the family of Semantic Web related W3CRecommendations RDFS, OWL, or SKOS are the tools of choice to define ontologies, whereasRIF has been developed to cover rule based approaches.What Inference is Used For?Inference on the Semantic Web is one of the tools of choice toimprove the quality of data integration on the Web, by discoveringnew relationships, automatically analysing the contentof the data, or managing knowledge on the Web in general. Inferencebased techniques are also important in discoveringpossible inconsistencies in the (integrated) data.ExamplesA simple example may help. The data set to be considered may include therelationship (Flipper isA Dolphin). An ontology may declare that everyDolphin is also a Mammal. That means that a Semantic Web programunderstanding the notion of X is also Y can addthe statement (Flipper isA Mammal) to the set ofrelationships, although that was not part of the original data. One can also say that the new relationshipwas discovered. Another example is to express that fact that if twopersons have the same name, home page, and email address, then they areidentical. In this case, the identity of two resources can bediscovered via inferencing.Usage and techniques of ontologies and rules largely overlap. Verybroadly speaking, ontologies optimize for taxonomic reasoning problems,and rule based systems optimize for reasoning problems within the data.The difference is largely a matter of style, and criteria like availableexpertise, ease of adapting to existing data, tooling support, maturityand costs, etc., should be considered as far more important when tryingto choose.Learn MoreThe Semantic Web community maintains a list of bookson a W3C Wiki page. Some of those booksare introductory in nature while others are conference proceedings ortextbook that address more advanced topics.Details of recent and upcomingSemantic Web related talks, given by the W3C Staff,the staff of the W3C Offices,and members of the W3C Working Groups are available separately; the slidesare usually publicly available. TheW3C also maintains a collection of SemanticWeb Case Studies and Use Cases thatshow how Semantic Web technologies, including inference, is used inpractice. Finally, the Semantic Web FAQ may also be of helpin understanding the various concepts.Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:RIF Rule Interchange FormatOWL Web Ontology LanguageRDFThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:Government Linked Data Working GroupLinked Data Platform (LDP) Working GroupRDF Working GroupRDFa Working GroupSemantic Web Interest GroupCurrent StatusRIF Rule Interchange FormatOWL Web Ontology LanguageRDFUse ItTutorialsBusiness CaseSoftwareValidatorsRDFFooter NavigationNavigationHomeStandardsParticipateMembershipAbout W3CContact W3CContactHelp and FAQSponsor / DonateSite MapFeedbackW3C UpdatesCopyright  2013 W3C  (MIT, ERCIM,Keio, Beihang) Usage policiesapply.////]]>
