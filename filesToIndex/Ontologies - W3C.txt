Vocabulariesare used to classifythe terms that can be used in a particular application, characterize possible relationships,and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be verycomplex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two conceptsonly).There is no clear division between what is referred to asvocabularies and ontologies. The trend is touse the word ontology for more complex, and possibly quite formal collection ofterms, whereas vocabulary is used when such strict formalism is not necessarilyused or only in a very loose sense. Vocabularies are the basic building blocksfor inference techniques on the Semantic Web.What are Vocabularies Used For?The role of vocabularies on the Semantic Web are to help data integration when,for example, ambiguities may exist on the terms used in the different data sets, or when a bitof extra knowledge may lead to the discovery of new relationships.Consider, for example, the application of ontologies in the field of health care.Medical professionals usethem to represent knowledge about symptoms, diseases, and treatments. Pharmaceutical companiesuse them to represent information about drugs, dosages, and allergies. Combining this knowledgefrom the medical and pharmaceutical communities with patient data enables a whole range ofintelligent applications such as decision support tools that search for possible treatments;systems that monitor drug efficacy and possible side effects; and tools that supportepidemiological research.Another type of example is to use vocabularies to organize knowledge. Libraries, museums,newspapers, government portals, enterprises, social networking applications, and othercommunities that manage large collections of books, historical artifacts, news reports,business glossaries, blog entries, and other items can now use vocabularies, usingstandard formalisms, to leverage the power of linked data.It depends on the application how complex vocabularies they use. Some applicationsmay decide not to use even small vocabularies, and rely on the logic of the application program.Some application may choose to use very simple vocabularies like the one described in theexamples section below, and let a general Semantic Web environment usethat extra information to make the identification of the terms.Some applications need an agreement on common terminologies, without any rigor imposed by a logic system.Finally, some applications may need more complex ontologies with complex reasoning procedures.It all depends on the requirements and the goals of the applications.To satisfy these different needs, W3C offers a large palette of techniques to describe anddefine different forms of vocabulariesin a standard format. These include RDF and RDF Schemas,Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS),Web Ontology Language (OWL), and theRule Interchange Format (RIF).The choice among these differenttechnologies depend on the complexity and rigor required by a specific application.ExamplesA general example may help. A bookseller may want to integrate data coming from different publishers.The data can be imported into a common RDF model, eg, by using converters to the publishersdatabases. However, one database may use the term author, whereas the other may use theterm creator. To make the integration complete, and extra definition should be added to the RDF data,describing the fact that the relationship described as author is the same as creator. Thisextra piece of information is, in fact, a vocabulary (or an ontology), albeit an extremely simple one.In a more complex case the application may need a more detailed ontology as part of the extrainformation. Thismay include formal description on how authors are to be uniquely identified (eg, in a USsetting, by referring to a unique social security number), how the terms used in this particularapplication relate to other datasets on the Web (eg, Wikipedia or geographic information), howthe term author (or creator) can be related to terms likeeditors, etc.Learn MoreThe Semantic Web community maintains a list of bookson a W3C Wiki page. Some of those booksare introductory in nature while others are conference proceedings ortextbook that address more advanced topics.Details of recent and upcomingSemantic Web related talks, given by the W3C Staff,the staff of the W3C Offices,and members of the W3C Working Groups are available separately; the slidesare usually publicly available. TheW3C also maintains a collection of SemanticWeb Case Studies and Use Cases thatshow how Semantic Web technologies, including vocabularies, are used inpractice. Finally, the Semantic Web FAQ may also be of helpin understanding the various concepts.Recent Press18 JuneSemantic Web JournalThe Semantic Web Journal Celebrates the 25th Anniversary of the Web26 MarchDigital JournalThe Apache Software Foundation Celebrates Document Freedom Day 2014Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:RDFOWL Web Ontology LanguageSKOSEvaluation and Report Language (EARL)Government Linked DataRDF vocabulariesThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:Evaluation and Repair Tools Working GroupGovernment Linked Data Working GroupLinked Data Platform (LDP) Working GroupRDF Working GroupRDFa Working GroupSemantic Web Interest GroupCurrent StatusRDFOWL Web Ontology LanguageSKOSEvaluation and Report Language (EARL)Government Linked DataRDF vocabulariesUse ItTutorialsBusiness CaseSoftwareValidatorsRDFLogosOWLPOWDERSKOSFooter NavigationNavigationHomeStandardsParticipateMembershipAbout W3CContact W3CContactHelp and FAQSponsor / DonateSite MapFeedbackW3C UpdatesCopyright  2013 W3C  (MIT, ERCIM,Keio, Beihang) Usage policiesapply.////]]>
