The ultimate goal of the Web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The term Semantic Web refers to W3Cs vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and SKOS.Linked DataThe Semantic Web is a Web of data  of dates and titlesand part numbers and chemical properties and any other data onemight conceive of. RDF provides the foundation for publishingand linking your data. Various technologies allow you toembed data in documents (RDFa, GRDDL) or expose what you havein SQL databases, or make it available as RDF files.VocabulariesAt times it may be important or valuable to organize data.Using OWL (to build vocabularies, or ontologies) and SKOS (for designingknowledge organization systems) it is possible toenrich data with additional meaning, which allows more people(and more machines) to do more with the data.QueryQuery languages go hand-in-hand with databases.If the Semantic Web is viewed as a global database, thenit is easy to understand why one would need a query languagefor that data. SPARQL is the query language for theSemantic Web.InferenceNear the top of the Semantic Web stack one finds inference reasoning over data through rules. W3C work on rules,primarily through RIF and OWL, isfocused on translating between rule languages andexchanging rules among different systems.Vertical ApplicationsW3C is working with different industries  for example inHealth Care and Life Sciences, eGovernment, and Energy  to improve collaboration,research and development, and innovation adoption throughSemantic Web technology. For instance, by aidingdecision-making in clinical research, Semantic Webtechnologies will bridge many forms of biological andmedical information across institutions.NewsAnnouncing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.017 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cSemanticWebVersion 7.0of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 newcharacters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols forthe Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-usedand historic scripts, as well as character additions to manyexisting scripts. These additions extend support for writtenlanguages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,and Africa. See the link above for full details. Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters inlong-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdingsfonts. Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. Newproperty values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach torendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joiningbehavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of thesyllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can besignificantly improved. Unicode character properties were extended to the newcharacters. The old characters have enhancements to Script andAlphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. Therewere also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as wellas new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperableimplementations. Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained insynchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version7.0. These will be released at the same time:UTS #10,Unicode Collation Algorithm the standard for sorting UnicodetextUTS #46,Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing for processing ofnon-ASCII URLs (IDNs)Workshop report: Summary of the LD4LT group kickoff / LIDERroadmapping workshop11 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cSemanticWebTheLIDER project haspublished a report on the firstLinked Data forLanguage Technology event, which was held 21st March inalignment with the European Data Forum in Athens.Read the report. Industry stakeholders from many areas (localization, publishing,language technology applications etc.) and key researchers fromlinked data and language technology discussed promises andchallenges around linguistic linked data. The report summarizes allpresentations and includes an initial list of use cases andrequirements for linguistic linked data. This and the overalloutcome of the event will feed into work of theLD4LT group (seeespecially theLD4LT latest draft version of use cases), and the field ofmultilingual linked data in general. TheLD4LT group is partof the MultilingualWeb community  learn more aboutrelatedprojects.Last Call draft published for Encoding spec06 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cSemanticWebA Last Call Working Draft ofEncodinghas been published. While encodings have been defined to some extent,implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealingwith undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. Thisspecification attempts to fill those gaps so that newimplementations do not have to reverse engineer encodingimplementations of the market leaders and existing implementationscan converge. The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version asof the date of its publication, intended to provide a stablereference for other specifications. We are hoping for people toreview the specification and send comments about any technicalareas that need attention (see the Status section for details). Please send comments by1 July 2014.One more week to FEISGILTT  learn about and contribute to thefuture of Web and localization standards!28 May2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cSemanticWebOn 4 June and as part of the Localization World conference inDublin, theFEISGILTT event will again provide an opportunity to discusslatest developments around localization and multilingual Webtechnologies. The event is sponsored by theLIDER project. Highlights include updates about ITS 2.0 and XLIFF 2.0, and asession about usage scenarios for linguistic linked data inlocalization.

Participation in both events is free. See theCall for Participation for details about how to register for theMultilingualWeb workshop. The LD4LT event requires aseparate registrationand you have the opportunity to submitposition statements about language resources and RDF. If you havent registered yet, note that space is limited, soplease be sure to register soon to ensure that you get a place. The MultilingualWeb workshops, funded by the European Commissionand coordinated by the W3C, look at best practices and standardsrelated to all aspects of creating, localizing and deploying themultilingual Web. The workshops are successful because they attracta wide range of participants, from fields such as localization,language technology, browser development, content authoring andtool development, etc., to create a holistic view of theinteroperability needs of the multilingual Web.
