However, the syntax rules of XML arestrict: XML tools will not process files that containerrors, but instead will give you error messages so thatyou fix them. This means that almost all XML documentscan be processed reliably by computer software.The main differences from HTML are:All elements must be closed or marked asempty.Empty elements can be closed as normal,<happiness></happiness>or you can use a special short-form,<happiness /> instead.In HTML, you only need to quote an attributevalue under certain circumstances (it contains aspace, or a character not allowed in a name), butthe rules are hard to remember. In XML,attribute values must always be quoted:<happiness type="joy" />In HTML there is a built-in set of element names(along with their attributes). In XML, thereare no built-in names (although names starting with xmlhave special meanings).In HTML, there is a list of some built-incharacter names like&eacute; for é but XMLdoes not have this. In XML, there are only fivebuilt-in character entities:&lt;,&gt;,&amp;,&quot; and&apos; for<,>,&," and' respectively. You can define your own entitiesin a Document Type Definition, or you can use anyUnicode character (see next item).In HTML, there are also numeric character references,such as &#38; for &. You can refer to any Unicodecharacter, but the number is decimal, whereas in the Unicodetables the number is usually in hexadecimal. XML also allowshexadecimal references: &#x26; for example.XML has a number of advantages over many other formats.For any particular scenario, you might be able to come upwith a better format, but then you would have to includecosts of converting and processing your format, and oftraining, and of the XML-specific editing and searching toolthat are now very widely available. Some of the advantagesof XML include:RedundancyXML markup is very verbose. For example, every end tag must besupplied, such as </description> in the example.This lets the computer catch common errors such as incorrectnesting.Self-describingThe readability of XML (it is a text-based format) and thepresence of element and attribute names in XML meansthat people looking at an XML document can often get a head starton understanding the format (and it also helps people tofind mistakes!)Network effect and the XML PromiseAny XML document can be read and processed by any XML toolwhatsoever. Of course, some XML tools might want specificXML markup, but the XML format itself can be read by anyXML parser: you can't say, this XML document is only tobe processed by such-and-such a tool.This means that every new XML document increases thevalue of every other XML document, and of every XML tool,and every new XML tool increases the value of every XMLdocument and hence of every other tool.Today, XML is the most widely-used format of its kindanywhere in the world.ExamplesXML is very widely used today. It is the basisof a great many standards such asthe Universal Business Language (UBL); ofUniversal Plug and Play (UPnP) used for home electronics;word processing formats such as ODF and OOXML;graphics formats such as SVG;it is used for communication with XMLRPC andWeb Services, it is supported directly bycomputer programming languages and databases,from giant servers all the way down tomobile telephones.If you double-click an icon on your computerdesktop (the icon may well have been drawnwith SVG), chances are that an XML message issent from one component of the desktop to another.If you take your car to be repaired, the engine'scomputer sends XML to the mechanic's diagnosticsystems. It is the age of XML: it is everywhere.Learn MoreThere are too many XML tutorials to list here.In most cases, people using XML for a specificpurpose will have written a tutorial. The XMLspecification itself is approximately 30 pages long,and is aimed at computer programmers andinformation specialists.Recent Press13 JuneLaboratory Equipment“Tech Lets You Track Your Data Online ”26 MarchDigital Journal“The Apache Software Foundation Celebrates Document Freedom Day 2014”Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:XMLXML CanonicalizationEfficient XML InterchangeXML-binary Optimized PackagingInternationalization of XMLXML Relationship to other formatsThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:Efficient XML Interchange Working GroupInternationalization Working GroupTechnical Architecture GroupXML Core Working GroupXML Processing Model Working GroupXML Security Working GroupContact: Liam R.
