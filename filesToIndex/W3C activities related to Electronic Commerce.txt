Another concernis the need for low friction commerce transactions allowing quality  andease of use for consumers, a key factor the future of  Electronic Commerce.The potential for global electronic commerce is immense; much of this potentialis and will be realized by the continued development of Web technologies.The World Wide Web Consortium, leading the web to its full potential, istherefore concerned with the evolution of Electronic Commerce on the Web.The role of W3C is to focus on core infrastructure technologies for ElectronicCommerce and identify common infrastructure needed in this area. W3Cis not committed for example in specifying banking systems nor schemas forspecific Electronic Commerce applications.W3C, through the following activities is committed to key factors for successin the evolution of Electronic Commerce:The Micropaymentinitiative specifies how to provide in a Web page all the informationnecessary to initialize a micropayment and transfer this information to thewallet for processing.The W3C Metadata Activity providesa means to  make statements and create machine-readable statements.The W3C Digital Signature Initiativeprovides a mechanism for signing documents and metadata in order to establishwho made the statement.The PICS Rules specificationallows to establish rules that can be understood by machines and exchangedby users.The Platform for Privacy PreferencesProject (P3P) provides communication about data privacy practices betweenconsumers and merchant sites on the Web as well as enhanced user controlover the use and disclosure of personal information.The now-completedJEPI project created theProtocol Extension Protocol(PEP) to provide for negotiation on the Web for binding terms and conditions.Major W3C common specifications for the Web in areas such asnetwork protocols,graphical user interface, remain thebasis of Electronic Commerce.2- W3C Activities related to Electronic CommerceActivities related to Electronic Commerce are widely spread across the allWorld Wide Web Consortium. TheElectronic CommerceActivity is the core framework in this area, but other activities withinW3C are also involved in  Electronic Commerce like in theTechnology & Society Domain whichhas addressed different issues on privacy, security, and content controlthat are major concerns in Electronic Commerce and for the web of trust.Therefore, technologies specified in  theTechnology & Society Domain,Architecture Domain andUser interface Domain  areprecious for the development and for the future of Electronic Commerce.The Consortium is committed in the following Electronic Commerce relatedtopics:2.1- The Electronic Commerce ActivityThe Electronic CommerceActivity is of course dedicated to this area. It hosts anElectronic Commerce Interest Groupserving as a forum to explore cooperation and exchange ideas. This Interest Group has lead to the creation of Working Groups for theMicropayment Initiative and the Electronic Payment Initiative.2.1.a- The Electronic Commerce Interest GroupThe Electronic Commerce InterestGroup is a forum designed to allow the members to evaluate potentialWeb technologies in the Electronic Commerce area and to share informationwith the Consortium staff and other members about:Problems they have encountered (and proposed solutions)Priorities (in addressing the problems)Work underway in related areasWhat role, if any, the Consortium should playThe Electronic Commerce Interest Group has met three times in the last twoyears, inBrussels,Seattle, andParis.There is an on-going email list(w3c-ecommerce-ig@w3.org andarchives[Member restricted]) associated with the Interest Group which is from itsbeginning very quiet.2.1.b- Micropayments InitiativeThe Electronic Commerce Activity is currently involved in realizing theopportunities inMicropayments, andthis has formed the main task of the Activity for the last 12 months.Micropayments arevery small payments made over the Web for documents that you access.Micropayments cover transactions which are too small to be economical ascredit card transactions, and can be as little as a fraction of a cent.Micropayments provide an alternative to subscription and advertising as asource of revenue. The Micropayments Initiative hosts two Working Groups:TheMicropaymentMarkup Working Group [Member restricted]: The embedding of paymentinformation in Web pages. This specification provides an extensible way toembed in a Web page all the information necessary to initialize a micropayment.TheMicropaymentsAPI Working Group [Member restricted]: The API to start the wallet andtransfer the information defined above to the wallet for processing.2.1.c- Electronic payment InitiativeThe Joint Electronic Payment Initiative(JEPI) was a primary initiativein the Electronic Commerce Activity. It has addressed a standardized wayof automatable negotiating payment methods between browsers and servers onthe Web.3.1- MetadataThe Metadata Activity is thearchitectural underpinning of many of the Technology and Society activities.W3C's work on Digital Signatures, Privacy Protection, and Intellectual PropertyRights Management are all based on the Resource Description Framework(RDF) work that is at the heart of theMetadata Activity. Recently, inthe Electronic Commerce activity, theCommon Markup forMicropayment Per-fee-links specification has suggested to use the RDFmetadata technology for describing micropayments information.3.2- Security and IntegrityOne element of trust in Electronic Commerce  is the ability to reliablyassociate a statement with the person or organization who made it. Whilethe underlying cryptographic technology to accomplish this is available andwidely known, it has not yet been applied to a general-purpose system forcreating machine readable statements. The Digital Signature Initiative(DSig) fills this important role byspecifying how to sign statements expressed as metadata.Another element of trust is the ability to digitally sign Web resources andportions of protocol messages (anything referenciable by a URI) and proceduresfor computing and verifying such signatures. It is the mission of  theXML-Signature WG to develop anXML compliant syntax for such mechanism.3.3- PrivacyElectronic Commerce involves the constant tension between the need for amerchant site to gain information about their costumers and the needfor these individuals to control the release of this information to others.The Platform for Privacy Preferences(P3P) addresses the twin goals of meetingthe data privacy expectations of consumers on the Web while assuring thatthe medium remains available and productive for Electronic Commerce. Followingthe principle of providing consumers notice of site privacy polices, andallowing users to express and act upon their privacy preferences in a flexiblemanner, one goal enhances the success of the other. In addition, P3P providesa mechanism developing standard, extensible data sets of personal informationto be transferred between user agents and servers,3.4- Content ControlThe Platform for Internet Content Selection(PICS) was created as an alternativemodel to centralized government controls on indecent content. PICS encouragesdecentralized parental empowerment when addressing children's access toinappropriate material.PICS is a pair of protocols that allows labels to be applied to Internetcontent. These protocols empower any individual or organization to designand distribute labels reflecting their views about the content. PICS wasspearheaded by the Consortium as a practical alternative to global governmentalcensorship of the Internet. In addition, the same technology facilitatessearching the Web, and providing a foundation for establishing trust ininformation on the Web.3.5- Intellectual Property RightsThe W3C is considering the issue of making it easier for users to complywith Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)policies. Combining payment and labeling technologies will make it simplefor IP owners to express the terms and conditions related to their materials,and for users to comply with the stated policies. Business policies are extremelyimportant to the development of the Electronic Commerce.3.6- XML schemaExtensible Markup Language (XML) willplay an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety ofdata on the Web, especially in Business to Business Electronic Commerce andElectronic Data Interchange.In addition to the XML, theXML Schema Working Group is addressing means for defining the structure, content and semanticsof such XML documents. TheXML Schema Requirementsdocument specifies the purpose, basic usage scenarios, design principles,and base requirements for an XML schema language.3.7- Other technical common specificationsTechnical common specifications as standards are critical to the long termElectronic Commerce success on the Internet as they can allow products andservices from different vendors to work together. They also encourage competitionand reduce uncertainty in the global marketplace. W3C, as a global and neutraltechnology development forum, develops common specifications for theWeb in areas such as network protocols, graphical user interface, allowingreliability, interoperability, ease of use and scalability in ElectronicCommerce on the web.The Consortium is also working towards making information on the Web accessibleto all kind of devices such as mobiles phones(Mobile Access) and television(TVWeb), thereforeextending the access range for consumers to Electronic Commerce.4- Acknowledged Submissions to W3Crelated to Electronic CommerceW3C Member organizations may submit submissions to propose technology orother ideas for consideration by W3C. W3C hasacknowledged Submissions fromMembers that are related to the Electronic Commerce area. These submissionswere brought to the attention of the participants in the Electronic CommerceInterest Group for consideration. Related Working Group are invited to pickup these Submissions for discussion as requirements and design input.These documents are also made available to the public for consideration.UCLP - The UniversalCommerce Language and Protocol is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) applicationfor metadata related to commercial products and companies and that can beused in identifying and retrieving product data residing across the Internet.ICE - The Informationand Content Exchange Protocol proposes a protocol and data format to implementthe shared business rules in the domain of syndicated content, on top ofthe Web infrastructure of XML, HTTP, and URIs.XFDL - The ExtensibleForms Description Language describes an XML syntax to represent complex formssuch as those found in business and government.SDML- The Signed DocumentMarkup Language describes how to structure a complete signed document, withthe material being signed as part of the document. We expect that a web-baseddocument signature scheme would have to address external documents, alsoreferenced by URI. SMDL was an important initial contribution to theXML Signature Working Group.5- Other resources related  to ElectronicCommerceFollowing is a non exhaustive list of resources related  to ElectronicCommerce:Biztalk - A community of standardsusers, with the goal of driving the rapid, consistent adoption of XML toenable electronic commerce and application integration.CommerceNet - CommerceNet is a non-profitmembership organization meeting the evolving needs of companies doing electroniccommerce. Since its founding in 1994, CommerceNet's mission has been to promoteand advance interoperable electronic commerce to support emerging communitiesof commerce.ECML - The Electronic Commerce ModelingLanguage provides a simple set of guidelines for web merchants that willenable digital wallets from multiple vendors to automate the exchange ofinformation between users and merchants.FSTC - The mission of the FinancialServices Technology Consortium (FSTC) is to leverage the strength of US financialservices organizations through joint research and development focused ontechnology opportunities, adding business value, managing risk, and reducingcosts.IOTP - The Open Trading Protocol was developedby a number of organisations, working co-operatively to make widespread Internettrading a convenient and secure reality.OASIS - A community resource designedto provide a credible source of accurate, timely information about theapplication of XML in industrial and commercial settings.XML/EDI- Provides a standard framework to exchange different types of data -- forexample, an invoice, healthcare claim, project status -- so that the informationbe it in a transaction, exchanged via an Application Program Interface (API),web automation, database portal, catalog, a workflow document or messagecan be searched, decoded, manipulated, and displayed consistently and correctlyby first implementing EDI dictionaries and extending our vocabulary via on-linerepositories to include our business language, rules and objects.6- ConclusionW3C work on Web technologies has an an important enabling impact on ElectronicCommerce. Members requesting Submission Acknowledgment from W3C have obviouslydemonstrated their interest in the Electronic Commerce area. Though theElectronic commerce Activity is currently working on Micropayments, we haveto envision the future of this activity. Based on reaction to this document,we will consider hosting a face-to-face meeting of the Electronic CommerceInterest Group shortly. Members are welcome to join the mailing list forthe Electronic Commerce Interest Group. To do so, please send mail tow3c-ecommerce-ig-request@w3.org.Members are, as always, invited to suggest new Web technologies to exploreand to demonstrated their motivation related to Electronic Commerce.
