This ability to operate on multipleinput files in multiple formats, and to treat them all as if they wereXML files, is very powerful. It is shared withXQuery, and with anythingelse using XPath 2.0:Template-Driven ApproachXSLT uses a template-driven approach to transformations:you write a template that shows what happens to any given input element.For example, if you were formatting a letter to produce HTML for the Web,you might have a template to match an underlined passage and make itcome out in italics:<template match="underline"><i><apply-templates/></i></template>Now suppose the input document contains the following fragment of XML:I <underline>really</underline>love XSLT!The template would match the underline element, and produce the followingHTML fragment:I <i>really</i>love XSLT!Wildly PopularXSLT has become the language of choice for a very widerange of XML applications. It is of course still used toproduce XSL-FO documents for printing, but it is also usedto integrate back-end software for Web sites. You willfind XSLT (version 1) inside most modern Web browsers,so that XML canbe transformed on the fly without the user even noticing;you will find XSLT on the desktop, in servers, in networkappliances, and forminga basic and dependable part of computer infrastructure almosteverywhere you look.What is XSLT Used For?If you make a purchase on eBay, or buy a book at Amazon,chances are that pretty much everything you see on everyWeb page has been processed with XSLT. Use XSLT toprocess multiple XML documents and to produce any combinationof text, HTML and XML output. XSLT support is shipped withall major computer operating systems today, as well asbeing built in to all major Web browsers.XSLT, XPath and XQueryXPath is a simple language for identifying parts of an XML documentthat are of interest. It is used by XSLT, and also by XLink;it is extended considerably by XQuery.XPath cannot be used stand-alone: it is always used in thecontext of a host language, whether that language is XSLT, Python,Perl, PHP, C#, JavaScript or some other language.XPath can be very powerful: for example, to find all div elementsthat have a class attribute of sock with a spanchild whose class attribute is equal to colour, onemight write,div[@class = "sock"]/span[@class = "colour"]To find a repairProcedure element containing a step elementthat uses part number 1976, we might write,repairProcedure[step//partno = 1976]Examples[more coming]Learn More[more coming]Recent Press26 MarchDigital Journal“The Apache Software Foundation Celebrates Document Freedom Day 2014”Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:XPathXSLTXSL-FOThese W3C Groups areworking on related specifications:XML Query Working GroupXSLT Working GroupInternationalization Working GroupXML Core Working GroupContactLiam R.
