If you do, you will build specifications and content that present barriers to the use of your technologyor content for many people around the world. Learn more below about:What is Internationalization?If you internationalize, you design or develop your content, application, specification, and so on, in a way that ensuresit will work well for, or can be easily adapted for, users from any culture, region, or language.The word 'Internationalization' is often abbreviated to 'i18n'. This is widely used abbreviation, derived from the fact thatthere are 18 letters between the 'i' and the 'n'.ExamplesOne fundamental aspect of internationalization is to ensure that the technology supports text in any writing system of theworld. This is why W3C technologies are built on the universal character set, Unicode. It may be necessary to also supportother legacy character sets and encodings.There are other factors to consider, however, when using characters. For example, Unicode based encodings allow the exactsame text to be stored using slightly different combinations of characters. For efficiency and accuracy in comparing, sortingand parsing text, the different sequences need to be recognised as 'canonically equivalent'. You need to consider how to managethis when developing applications or specifications that perform or rely on such tasks.Sometimes different writing systems require special support. For example, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Mongolian can be written vertically,so the W3C is ensuring CSS, SVG and XSL-FO will allow for vertical text support. Text alignment and justification methodsare also different for such scripts, and different again for scripts like Thai and Tibetan. Other local typographic conventions often exist for such things as emphasis, annotations, list numbering, and the like. These typographic approachesneed to be supported in style sheets.Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Urdu and similar languages mix right-to-left and left-to-right text on the same line, and it is important to be able to control thedirection of the surrounding context for that to work properly. This means that schema and format developers need to provideways for authors to control direction in their content. Schemas, markup languages and formats should also support a numberof other constructs needed for efficient handling of content during translation and localisation.If you are dealing with HTML forms or designing ontologies relating to people's names and addresses, you will need to considerhow to enable the many different approaches to formatting data that are possible around the world.You may also need to support alternative calendars, time zones and daylight savings, names and addresses in both native plus transliterated forms, etc.Content developers and content management systems must also be prepared to deal with linguistic and cultural issues. Forexample, a sentence that is constructed by combining several phrases together in one language may be impossible to translatesensibly in a language with a different sentence structure. For example, in the Japanese translation of "Page 1 of 34" allelements in the phrase would be in reverse order. Your application must not restrict the order in which these elements canbe combined.Specifications for technologies such as widgets and voice browsers should also avoid locking developers into an English-biased syntax for such things as composing messages or firing events associated with text.Cultural problems also need to be considered. Symbolism can be culture-specific. The check mark means correct or OK in manycountries. In some countries, however, such as Japan, it can be used to mean that something is incorrect. Japanese localizers may need to convert check marks to circles (their symbol for 'correct') as part of the localizationprocess.These are just a few examples of many. The key message is that design (whether it be of a markup language, a protocol, acontent management system, a widget or application, etc.) needs to be flexible enough to accommodate local needs.Learn moreTry one of our task-oriented listings below or go to the Internationalization Activity home page.
