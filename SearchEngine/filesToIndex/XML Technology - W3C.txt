They address issues when using XML inspecific applications contexts.SchemaFormal descriptions of vocabularies create flexibility inauthoring environments and quality control chains. W3C’s XML Schema,SML, and data binding technologies provide the tools for qualitycontrol of XML data.SecurityManipulating data with XML requires sometimes integrity,authentication and privacy. XML signature, encryption, andxkms can help create a secure environment for XML.TransformationVery frequently one wants to transform XML contentinto other formats (including other XML formats).XSLT and XPath are very powerful tools forcreating differentrepresentations of XML content.QueryXQuery (supported by XPath)is a query language for XML to extract data, similarto the role of SQL for databases, or SPARQL for the SemanticWeb.ComponentsThe XML ecosystem is using additional tools to create aricher environment for using and manipulating XMLdocuments. These components include style sheets, xlinkxml:id, xinclude, xpointer, xforms, xml fragments, andevents.ProcessingA processing model defines whatoperations should be performed in what orderon an XML document.InternationalizationW3C has worked with the community on the internationalizationof XML, for instance for specifying the language of XML content.PublishingXML grew out of the technical publication community.Use XSL-FO to publish even largeor complex multilingual XMLdocuments to HTML, PDF or otherformats; include SVG diagramsand MathML formulas in the output.NewsAnnouncing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.017 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cXMLCoreVersion 7.0of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 newcharacters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols forthe Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-usedand historic scripts, as well as character additions to manyexisting scripts. These additions extend support for writtenlanguages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,and Africa. See the link above for full details. Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters inlong-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdingsfonts. Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. Newproperty values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach torendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joiningbehavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of thesyllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can besignificantly improved. Unicode character properties were extended to the newcharacters. The old characters have enhancements to Script andAlphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. Therewere also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as wellas new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperableimplementations. Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained insynchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version7.0. These will be released at the same time:UTS #10,Unicode Collation Algorithm— the standard for sorting UnicodetextUTS #46,Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing— for processing ofnon-ASCII URLs (IDNs)Workshop report: Summary of the LD4LT group kickoff / LIDERroadmapping workshop11 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cXMLCoreTheLIDER project haspublished a report on the firstLinked Data forLanguage Technology event, which was held 21st March inalignment with the European Data Forum in Athens.Read the report. Industry stakeholders from many areas (localization, publishing,language technology applications etc.) and key researchers fromlinked data and language technology discussed promises andchallenges around linguistic linked data. The report summarizes allpresentations and includes an initial list of use cases andrequirements for linguistic linked data. This and the overalloutcome of the event will feed into work of theLD4LT group (seeespecially theLD4LT latest draft version of use cases), and the field ofmultilingual linked data in general. TheLD4LT group is partof the MultilingualWeb community – learn more aboutrelatedprojects.Last Call draft published for Encoding spec06 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cXMLCoreA Last Call Working Draft ofEncodinghas been published. While encodings have been defined to some extent,implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealingwith undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. Thisspecification attempts to fill those gaps so that newimplementations do not have to reverse engineer encodingimplementations of the market leaders and existing implementationscan converge. The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version asof the date of its publication, intended to provide a stablereference for other specifications. We are hoping for people toreview the specification and send comments about any technicalareas that need attention (see the Status section for details). Please send comments by1 July 2014.One more week to FEISGILTT – learn about and contribute to thefuture of Web and localization standards!28 May2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cXMLCoreOn 4 June and as part of the Localization World conference inDublin, theFEISGILTT event will again provide an opportunity to discusslatest developments around localization and multilingual Webtechnologies.
