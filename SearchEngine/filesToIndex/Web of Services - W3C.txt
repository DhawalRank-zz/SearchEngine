The Web of Services is based on technologies such as HTTP, XML, SOAP, WSDL, SPARQL, and others.ProtocolsDepending on the application constraints for exchangingdata across the Web, developers can choose among a seriesof protocols such as HTTP, SOAP and Web Services.Service DescriptionIn specific environments, Web services description definesformally machine readable interfaces for accessing thedata. WSDL, SML, and choreography and policy specificationsenable descriptions, and Web Services and Semantic Webconnect through semantic annotations.SecurityTransferring data from one domain to another domain orbetween applications needs sometimes a secure transactionand well defined document authentication. XML Encryption andXML Signature are key pieces of the XML security stack.InternationalizationInternationalization of Web services concerns service descriptions,communicating language and locale, and internationizationof human-readable messages exchanged by services.NewsAnnouncing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.017 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cWebServicesVersion 7.0of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 newcharacters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols forthe Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-usedand historic scripts, as well as character additions to manyexisting scripts. These additions extend support for writtenlanguages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,and Africa. See the link above for full details. Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters inlong-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdingsfonts. Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. Newproperty values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach torendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joiningbehavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of thesyllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can besignificantly improved. Unicode character properties were extended to the newcharacters. The old characters have enhancements to Script andAlphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. Therewere also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as wellas new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperableimplementations. Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained insynchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version7.0. These will be released at the same time:UTS #10,Unicode Collation Algorithm the standard for sorting UnicodetextUTS #46,Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing for processing ofnon-ASCII URLs (IDNs)Workshop report: Summary of the LD4LT group kickoff / LIDERroadmapping workshop11 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cWebServicesTheLIDER project haspublished a report on the firstLinked Data forLanguage Technology event, which was held 21st March inalignment with the European Data Forum in Athens.Read the report. Industry stakeholders from many areas (localization, publishing,language technology applications etc.) and key researchers fromlinked data and language technology discussed promises andchallenges around linguistic linked data. The report summarizes allpresentations and includes an initial list of use cases andrequirements for linguistic linked data. This and the overalloutcome of the event will feed into work of theLD4LT group (seeespecially theLD4LT latest draft version of use cases), and the field ofmultilingual linked data in general. TheLD4LT group is partof the MultilingualWeb community  learn more aboutrelatedprojects.Last Call draft published for Encoding spec06 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cWebServicesA Last Call Working Draft ofEncodinghas been published. While encodings have been defined to some extent,implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealingwith undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. Thisspecification attempts to fill those gaps so that newimplementations do not have to reverse engineer encodingimplementations of the market leaders and existing implementationscan converge. The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version asof the date of its publication, intended to provide a stablereference for other specifications. We are hoping for people toreview the specification and send comments about any technicalareas that need attention (see the Status section for details). Please send comments by1 July 2014.One more week to FEISGILTT  learn about and contribute to thefuture of Web and localization standards!28 May2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog  w3cWebServicesOn 4 June and as part of the Localization World conference inDublin, theFEISGILTT event will again provide an opportunity to discusslatest developments around localization and multilingual Webtechnologies.

With over 30 million articles in 286 languagesas ofJanuary 1, 2014, Wikipedia has now become one of the largestproviders of multilingual content in the world. Because of itsuser-generated and constantly changing content, many traditionalprocesses for managing multilingual content on the web either donot work or do not scale well for Wikipedia. Alolita Sharmaskeynote will highlight Wikipedias diversity in multilingualuser-generated content and the language technologies that Wikipediahas had to develop to support its unprecedented growth of content.She will also discuss the many challenges Wikipedia faces inproviding language support for the mobile web. The Multilingual Web Workshop series brings togetherparticipants interested in the best practices, new technologies,and standards needed to help content creators, localizers, languagetools developers, and others address the new opportunities andchallenges of the multilingual Web. It will provide for networkingacross communities and building connections. Registration for the Workshop is free, andearlyregistrationis recommended since space at the Workshop islimited. There is still opportunity for individuals to submit proposalsto speak at the workshop.
