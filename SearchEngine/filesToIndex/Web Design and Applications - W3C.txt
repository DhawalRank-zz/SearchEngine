This section also includes information on how to make pages accessible to people with disabilities (WCAG), to internationalize them, and make them work on mobile devices.HTML & CSSHTML and CSS are the fundamental technologies for buildingWeb pages: HTML (html and xhtml) for structure, CSS forstyle and layout, including WebFonts. Find resources for good Web page designas well as helpful tools.JavaScript Web APIsStandard APIs for client-side Web Applicationdevelopment include those for Geolocation, XMLHttpRequest, andmobile widgets. W3C standards for document models (the“DOM”) and technologies such as XBLallow content providers to create interactivedocuments through scripting.GraphicsW3C is the home of the widely deployed PNG raster format,SVG vector format, and the Canvas API. WebCGM is a more specializedformat used, for example, in the fields of automotive engineering,aeronautics.Audio and VideoSome of the W3C formats that enable authoring audio and videopresentations include HTML, SVG, and SMIL (for synchronization).W3C is also working on a timed text format for captioning andother applications.AccessibilityW3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has publishedWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) tohelp authors create content that isaccessible to people with disabilities. WAI-ARIA gives authorsmore tools to create accessible Web Applications by providingadditional semantics about widgets and behaviors.InternationalizationW3C has a mission to design technology that works acrosscultures and languages. W3C standards such as HTMLand XML are built on Unicode, for instance. In addition,W3C has published guidance for authors related to language tagsbi-directional (bidi) text, and more.Mobile WebW3C promotes “One Web” that is available on any device.W3C’s Mobile Web Best Practices help authors understandhow to create content that provides a reasonableexperience on a wide variety of devices, contexts, andlocations.PrivacyThe Web is a powerful tool for communications and transactionsof all sorts. It is important to consider privacy andsecurity implications of the Web as part of technology design. Learn more about tracking and Web App security.Math on the WebMathematics and formula are used on the Web for businessreports, education materials and scientific research. W3C’s MathMLenables mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for other types ofcontent.NewsHTML5: On Our Way to Recommendation17 June2014fromW3C HTMLWorking GroupIn 2012, the HTML Working Group Chairs came up with a plan toprogress HTML, aka “Plan 2014“. The plan has several objectives:Produce a W3C Recommendation for HTML 5.0 before the end of2014, as well as a W3C Recommendation for HTML 5.1 before the endof 2016;Use the Candidate Recommendation of HTML5, which started inDecember 2012, to focus the testing effort where it isappropriate;Use modularity to manage the size and complexity of thespecifications.Over the past 2 years, we have continued to refine and improvethe HTML 5.0 specification. The HTML Working Group receives andtracks proposals from a variety of people in the community, mostprominently from the WHATWG. During the past 2 years, the HTML5editors have worked with the community to exchange ideas and thusavoid divergence among specifications. TheHTML Landscapeliststhe differences between various HTML specifications. The HTML Working Group today has 97,000 tests for HTML5. As partof satisfying the W3C process requirements for CandidateRecommendation, we have tracked implementations of HTML5 features,andtest results today show that there are at least 2implementations for 96.7% of the available tests. What about theother 3.3%? Those failures arise from how different browsers handleerrors, and the Working Group has concluded that these failures donot reflect differences in implementations that will significantlyaffect interoperability of real-world running code. Following thetest results, we removedseveral features from HTML 5.0due to their lack ofimplementations and stability, including the dialog element andscoped style sheet. Those features remain in the draft HTML 5.1specification for the time being. W3C would like to thank the community for helping to build thisvaluable test suite. The tests come from theTest the WebForward community effort and the contributors to theweb-platform-tests github repository, and we strongly encourageWeb developers to continue to contribute to the testing effort andhelp make the Open Web Platform reliable. At the moment, the HTMLWorking Group is specifically looking for additional HTML 5.0 testsrelated tomedia elements andpage navigation. Asplanned, given the substantive changes made to the document,we’re returning HTML 5.0 to Last Call. The scope of the expectedfeedback at this point is limited to changes that have taken placeduring the Candidate Recommendation phase and the deadline is 15July 2014. Once we have addressed the Last Call comments andfinalize the test suite, we expect to move the document to ProposedRecommendation in the fall. A few features may be removed from HTML5.0 but kept in HTML 5.1 if we can’t get enough implementations:the DataCue interface, <input type=time>, drag and drop, andthe new ruby model. Advancing HTML 5.0 towards Recommendation status is just onestep in advancing the Open Web Platform, a full-fledged programmingenvironment for rich, interactive, cross-platform applications,with HTML5 at its core. Several Groups are extending the HTMLmarkup language, including for responsive design, performance,accessibility or additional security purposes. The HTML WorkingGroup, the W3C Technical Architecture Group and the WebApplications Working Group, are looking to have an Extensible WebSummit in the middle of September where we will discuss the futureof HTML. We expect a formal announcement in early July.Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.017 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebDesignVersion 7.0of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 newcharacters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols forthe Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-usedand historic scripts, as well as character additions to manyexisting scripts. These additions extend support for writtenlanguages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,and Africa. See the link above for full details. Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters inlong-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdingsfonts. Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. Newproperty values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach torendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joiningbehavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of thesyllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can besignificantly improved. Unicode character properties were extended to the newcharacters. The old characters have enhancements to Script andAlphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. Therewere also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as wellas new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperableimplementations. Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained insynchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version7.0. These will be released at the same time:UTS #10,Unicode Collation Algorithm— the standard for sorting UnicodetextUTS #46,Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing— for processing ofnon-ASCII URLs (IDNs)Workshop report: Summary of the LD4LT group kickoff / LIDERroadmapping workshop11 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebDesignTheLIDER project haspublished a report on the firstLinked Data forLanguage Technology event, which was held 21st March inalignment with the European Data Forum in Athens.Read the report. Industry stakeholders from many areas (localization, publishing,language technology applications etc.) and key researchers fromlinked data and language technology discussed promises andchallenges around linguistic linked data. The report summarizes allpresentations and includes an initial list of use cases andrequirements for linguistic linked data. This and the overalloutcome of the event will feed into work of theLD4LT group (seeespecially theLD4LT latest draft version of use cases), and the field ofmultilingual linked data in general. TheLD4LT group is partof the MultilingualWeb community – learn more aboutrelatedprojects.Last Call draft published for Encoding spec06 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebDesignA Last Call Working Draft ofEncodinghas been published. While encodings have been defined to some extent,implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealingwith undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. Thisspecification attempts to fill those gaps so that newimplementations do not have to reverse engineer encodingimplementations of the market leaders and existing implementationscan converge. The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version asof the date of its publication, intended to provide a stablereference for other specifications. We are hoping for people toreview the specification and send comments about any technicalareas that need attention (see the Status section for details). Please send comments by1 July 2014.Updates to two Working Group Notes published06 June2014fromInternationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebDesignAuthoring HTML: Handling Right-to-left Scripts andAuthoring HTML: Language declarationshave both been updated toa new format that lists do’s and don’ts, but points to existing ornew articles for detailed information. This will significantly helpin keeping the material up to date in the future as technologychanges. The documents have also been thoroughly overhauled toreflect the latest changes and information on The first document provides advice to content authors using HTMLmarkup and CSS style sheets about how to create pages for languagesthat use right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian,Thaana, Urdu, etc. It explains how to create content inright-to-left scripts that builds on but goes beyond the Unicodebidirectional algorithm, as well as how to prepare content forlocalization into right-to-left scripts. The second helps content authors specify the language ofcontent, which is useful for a wide number of applications, fromlinguistically-sensitive searching to applying language-specificdisplay properties. In some cases the potential applications forlanguage information are still waiting for implementations to catchup, whereas in others it is a necessity today. Adding markup forlanguage information to content is something that can and should bedone now and as content is first developed. If not, it will be muchmore difficult to take advantage of any future developments.Last week: WebRTC, Net Neutrality, HTML5 advertising defeats Flash,etc.02 June2014fromW3C HTMLWorking GroupThis is the26 May – 2 June 2014edition of a “weekly digest ofW3C news and trends” that I prepare for the W3C Membership andpublic-w3c-digest mailing list (publiclyarchived).
