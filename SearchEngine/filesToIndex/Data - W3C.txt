The collection of Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SKOS, SPARQL, etc.) providesan environment where application can query that data, draw inferencesusing vocabularies, etc.However, to make the Web of Data a reality, it isimportant to have the huge amount of data on the Web available in a standard format, reachable andmanageable by Semantic Web tools. Furthermore, not only does the Semantic Web need access todata, but relationships among data should be made available, too, to createa Web of Data (as opposed to a sheer collection of datasets). This collection ofinterrelated datasets on the Web can also be referred to as Linked Data.To achieve and create Linked Data, technologies should be available for a common format (RDF),to make either conversion or on-the-fly access to existing databases (relational, XML, HTML, etc). It is also important to be able to setupquery endpoints to access that data more conveniently.W3C provides a palette of technologies (RDF, GRDDL, POWDER, RDFa, the upcoming R2RML,RIF, SPARQL) to get access to the data.What is Linked Data Used For?Linked Data lies at the heart of what Semantic Web is all about: large scale integration of, andreasoning on, data on the Web. Almost all applications listed in, saycollection of Semantic Web Case Studiesand Use Cases are essentially based on the accessibility of, and integration of Linked Data at variouslevel of complexities.ExamplesA typical case of a large Linked Dataset is DBPedia,which, essentially, makes the content of Wikipedia available in RDF. The importance of DBPedia isnot only that it includes Wikipedia data, but also that itincorporates links to other datasets on the Web, e.g., toGeonames. By providing those extra links(in terms of RDF triples) applications may exploit the extra (and possibly more precise)knowledge from other datasets when developing an application; by virtue of integrating facts fromseveral datasets, the application may provide a much better user experience.Learn MoreTim Berners-Lee's note on Linked Data gives a succinct description of the Linked Data principles.The Semantic Web community also maintains a list of bookson a W3C Wiki page. Some of those booksare introductory in nature while others are conference proceedings ortextbook that address more advanced topics.Details of recent and upcomingSemantic Web related talks, given by the W3C Staff,the staff of the W3C Offices,and members of the W3C Working Groups are available separately; the slidesare usually publicly available. TheW3C also maintains a collection of SemanticWeb Case Studies and Use Cases thatshow how Semantic Web technologies, including Linked Data, are used inpractice.Recent Press18 JuneSemantic Web JournalThe Semantic Web Journal Celebrates the 25th Anniversary of the Web13 JuneLaboratory EquipmentTech Lets You Track Your Data Online 26 MarchDigital JournalThe Apache Software Foundation Celebrates Document Freedom Day 201420 MarchBusinessWirePharmaceutical and IT Communities Collaborate on OASIS Clinical Trial Data Standard for Content Management SystemsCurrent Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:RDFRDF Best PracticesRDFaRDF Relationship to Other FormatsGRDDLPOWDERSemantic Annotation for WSDL and XML SchemaProvenanceRDB2RDFLinked DataThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:Government Linked Data Working GroupLinked Data Platform (LDP) Working GroupRDF Working GroupRDFa Working GroupSemantic Web Interest GroupCurrent StatusRDFRDF Best PracticesRDFaRDF Relationship to Other FormatsGRDDLPOWDERSemantic Annotation for WSDL and XML SchemaProvenanceRDB2RDFLinked DataUse ItTutorialsBusiness CaseSoftwareValidatorsRDFLogosRDFFooter NavigationNavigationHomeStandardsParticipateMembershipAbout W3CContact W3CContactHelp and FAQSponsor / DonateSite MapFeedbackW3C UpdatesCopyright  2013 W3C  (MIT, ERCIM,Keio, Beihang) Usage policiesapply.////]]>
