There are several different schema languagesin widespread use, but the main ones are Document Type Definitions (DTDs),Relax-NG, Schematron and W3C XSD (XML Schema Definitions).From this page you can find out more about DTDs and W3C XSD,since those are the primary schema languages defined at W3C.What is XML Schema Used For?A Schema can be used:to provide a list of elements and attributes in a vocabulary;to associate types, such as integer, string, etc., or morespecifically such as hatsize, sock_colour, etc., with values foundin documents;to constrain where elements and attributes can appear, and whatcan appear inside those elements, such as saying that a chapter titleoccurs inside a chapter, and that a chapter must consist of achapter title followed by one or more paragraphs of text;to provide documentation that is both human-readable andmachine-processable;to give a formal description of one or more documents.Information in schema documents is often used by XML-aware editingsystems so that they can offer users the most likely elements to occurat any given location in a document.Checking a document against a Schema is known as validating againstthat schema; for a DTD, this is just validating, but for anyother type of schema the type is mentioned, such as XSD Validation orRelax-NG validation.Validating against a schema is an important componentof quality assurance.The Service Modeling Language (SML) provides a framework forrelating multiple XSD documents to one or more documents in asingle validation episode.Since XSD supports associating data types with element andattribute content, it is also used for data binding,that is, for software components that read and write XMLrepresentations of computer programming-language objects.ExamplesDocument Type Definitions are defined in the XML Recommendation.They are very widely supported with a high degree of interoperability.W3C XML Schema Definitions are defined in the W3C XML Schemaspecification.
