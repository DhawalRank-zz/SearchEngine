Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3Cpublications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found inthe W3C technical reports index athttp://www.w3.org/TR/.This is the 1 April 2014href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#WGNote">title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C Working Group Note of"Vocabularies for EmotionML".This document represents an important complement to the Emotion MarkupLanguage specification [EmotionML], i.e., a publiccollection of emotion vocabularies that can be used with EmotionML. It wasoriginally part of an earlier draft of the EmotionML specification, but wasmoved out of it because of the quasi-static nature of Recommendation Trackdocuments. Publishing the vocabularies as a separate document allows us toprovide updates, extensions and corrections of the list of vocabularies asrequired, without having to follow the multiple steps involved in releasing anew version of a Recommendation.The present document serves as a repository of emotion vocabulariesin both human-readable and machine-readable form. Even though itshref="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-emotion-voc-20110407/">first version waspublished as a Working Draft, the document status has been changed to W3CWorking Group Note to allow for occasional updates without raising theexpectation of progressing towards a normative Recommendation. Since the workdescribed here reflects an evolving state of the art on Emotion vocabularies,the Working Group believes it is premature to propose a normativeRecommendation on Vocabularies at this time.The main differences from the previous version are:adding the version information in the computer-readable definition of emotion vocabularieschanging the file extension of the computer-readabledefinition of emotion vocabularies from ".xml" to ".emotionml"based on the definition inthe EmotionMLspecificationThe following editorial changes are also made:updating the reference to the EmotionML specification with its Proposed Recommendation in Section 6.1updating the link to Ekman's "Universals and Cultural Differences in Facial Expressions of Emotion" in Section 6.2Any future updates to this Note will respect the repository-typenature of this document, as described in Section1.1.This W3C Working GroupNote has been developed by the MultimodalInteraction Working Group of thetitle="World Wide Web Consortium">W3Chref="http://www.w3.org/2002/mmi/Activity.html">Multimodal InteractionActivity. It represents consensus in the group's EmotionML subgroup. Thegroup is likely to produce new versions of this document, but will strive tomaintain syntactic compatibility with the current version. In particular theXML identifiers of vocabularies and the items in each vocabulary can beexpected to remain valid with future versions of this Note. It is expected thatany updates to this document will mostly add new vocabularies, or addexplanations to existing vocabularies and/or vocabulary items.Comments for this note are welcomed and should have a subject starting withthe prefix '[emotion-voc]'.

EmotionML provides mechanisms to represent emotions in terms ofscientifically valid descriptors: categories, dimensions, appraisals, andaction tendencies. Given the lack of agreement in the community, EmotionML doesnot provide a single vocabulary of emotion terms, but gives users a choice toselect the most suitable emotion vocabulary in their annotations. In order topromote interoperability, publicly defined vocabularies should be used wherepossible and reasonable from the point of view of the target application. Thepresent document provides a number of emotion vocabularies that can be used forthis purpose.The guiding principle for selecting emotion vocabularies for inclusion inthis document has been to list vocabularies that are either:commonly used in technological contexts, orrepresent current emotion models from the scientific literature.In addition, given the difficulty to define mappings between emotioncategories, dimensions, appraisals and action tendencies, we have includedpairs or groups of vocabularies where these mappings are rather well defined.Future versions of EmotionML can use these vocabularies as a starting point todefine mappings between different emotion descriptions.The selection of emotion vocabularies in this document is necessarilyincomplete; users are likely to find emotion vocabularies to be missing. Thereare two ways how a user can address this situation. First, users can easilywrite a definition for a custom emotion vocabulary as described in theEmotionML specification's section onhref="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotionml/#s3">Defining vocabularies. Secondly,feedback on the selection of emotion vocabularies in this document is highlyappreciated. Future versions of this document can include corrections and morethorough explanations for the existing vocabularies, and add additionalvocabularies which may be of interest to a wider audience. Please send commentsto www-multimodal@w3.org (withhref="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-multimodal/">publicarchive).1.1 Repository nature of this documentThe present document serves as a repository of emotion vocabulariesin both human-readable and machine-readable form. Any future updates to thisNote will respect the repository-type nature of this document, bymaintaining backward-compatibility as follows:all future updates will retain all existing names of vocabularies and ofexisting vocabulary items;new vocabularies may added under new names, and new items may be added toexisting vocabularies;new metadata may be added to vocabularies and items, in order to specifyin more detail the intended meaning and properties of the vocabularies anditems as defined in the present documents and in the original literaturefrom which the vocabularies were extracted.Should any corrections to existing vocabularies be required which wouldbreak the above-mentioned backward-compatibility rules, the correctedvocabulary will be published under a new name alongside the original,uncorrected vocabulary.1.2 Use of undated URIs to refer to vocabularies in thisdocumentGiven the repository nature of the document, references to the vocabulariesshould use the undated "Latest Version" URI of this document to refer toemotion vocabularies, as shown in the examples below, and not the dated "ThisVersion" URI. This promotes interoperability. Furthermore, it makes it possiblefor older documents to automatically benefit from updates to the repository,such as new metadata being added to existing vocabularies. Since documentsalways refer to the latest, compatible version of a vocabulary via the "LatestVersion" URI, it becomes possible to process older documents in terms of thenewest metadata without having to update the documents.2 Emotion category vocabulariesThis section provides vocabularies for use with thehref="#ref-emotionml">EmotionMLhref="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotionml/#s2.2.1"><category>element.2.1 Ekman's "big six" basic emotionsThese six terms are proposed by Paul Ekman (Ekman,1972, p. 251-252) as basic emotions with universal facial expressions --emotions that are recognized and produced in all human cultures.summary="vocabulary definition">TermRemarksangerdisgustfearhappinesssadnesssurpriseThe computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example.<emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#big6"><category name="anger"/></emotion>2.2 Everyday emotion vocabularyThese 17 terms are the result of a study by Cowie et al.
