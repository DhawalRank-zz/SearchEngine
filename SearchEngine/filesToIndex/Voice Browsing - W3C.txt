This provides the developer with anenvironment that will be familiar to those who are familiar with Webdevelopment techniques.What is Voice Browsing? - Part of W3C's One Web VisionVoice Browsing refers to using speech to navigate an application. Theseapplications are written using parts of the Speech Interface Framework. Inmuch the same way that Web applications are written in HTML and are rendered in a Webbrowser, speech applications are written in VoiceXML and are rendered via a VoiceBrowser.Real-world voice-driven Web applications abound, though people maynot always realize they are interacting with a Web service; examplesinclude airline departure and arrival information, bankingtransactions, automated phone appointment reminders, and automatedtelephone receptionists. By one estimate, over 85% of InteractiveVoice Response (IVR) applications for telephones (including mobile)use W3C's VoiceXML standard.What is Voice Browsing Used For?There are 10 times as many phones in the world as connected PCs.Phones will become the major portal to the Web. Speech recognition isnot yet widely associated with the 'visual Web', but this will changeas devices continue to shrink and make keyboards impractical, and ascell phones become more prevalent in regions with low literacyrates.Asking for directions while driving and hearing the responsethrough speech synthesis illustrates how practical "hands-free"applications can be to mobile users. Voice applications also benefitpeople with some disabilities (such as vision limitations) and peoplewho cannot read.W3C considers voice access to be one piece of more general"multimodal" access, where users can use combinations of means tointeract: voice input, speech feedback, electronic ink, touch input,and physical gestures (such as those used in some video games). The Voice Browser Working Group and the Multimodal Interaction Working Group arecoordinating their efforts to make the Web available on more devicesand in more situations.ExamplesSome possible applications of Voice Browsing include:Accessing business information, including the corporate "front desk" asking callers who or what they want, automated telephone ordering services, support desks, order tracking, airline arrival and departure information, cinema and theater booking services, and home banking services such as transferring money from one account to another, purchasing an item, trading stock.Accessing public information, including community information such as weather, traffic conditions, school closures, directions and events; local, national and international news; national and international stock market information; and business and e-commerce transactions.Accessing personal information, including calendars, address and telephone lists, to-do lists, shopping lists, and calorie counters.Assisting the user to communicate with other people via sending and receiving voice-mail and email messages.Learn MoreThe mission of the Voice Browser Working Groupis to enable users to speak and listen to Web applications bycreating standard languages for developing Web-based speechapplications. The Voice Browser Working Group concentrates onlanguages for capturing and producing speech and managing the dialogbetween user and computer, while a related Group, the MultimodalInteraction Working Group, concentrates on additional input modesincluding keyboard and mouse, ink and pen, etc.Visit the Voice Browser Activity home page formore information.Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:VoiceThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:Voice Browser Working GroupCascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working GroupContact:Kazuyuki Ashimura<ashimura@w3.org>Current StatusVoiceUse ItImplementationsTutorialsBusiness CaseSoftwareFooter NavigationNavigationHomeStandardsParticipateMembershipAbout W3CContact W3CContactHelp and FAQDonateSite MapFeedbackW3C UpdatesCopyright © 2013 W3C ® (MIT, ERCIM,Keio, Beihang) Usage policiesapply.////]]>
