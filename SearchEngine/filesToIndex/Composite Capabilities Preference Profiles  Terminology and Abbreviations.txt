Terminology2. Abbreviations3. References1. TerminologyThe key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "MAY," and "MAYNOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [href="#[RFC2119]">RFC2119].The following terms are used in this document.AnonymizationHiding the identity of the user as ahref="#Security">security precaution.Assurance of originInformation provided to the receiver of amessage that allows it to be certain of the origin of the message. (Thisassurance may not be sufficient to convince any other party about theorigin of the message.)Assurance of receiptInformation provided to the sender of a messagethat allows it to be certain that the message was delivered to itsintended recipient. This is not necessarily a proof of receipt.AttributesA CC/PP attribute refers to the data elements describing thehref="#Profile">profile and is denoted as an RDF property. EachCC/PP attribute is associated with a value or a list of values orresources.AuthenticationSome communication process that provides definite and tamper-proofinformation about the identity of a communicating party.AuthorizationPermission to view or modify a dataresource, or to perform some other action. Authorization is usuallygranted to an identified entity, and thus depends onhref="#Authentication">authentication of the party performing theaction.CC/PP RepositoryA server that stores the user agentprofile or profile segments persistently in aform that may be referenced by and incorporated into a profile. A CC/PPrepository is typically a Web server that provides CC/PP profiles orhref="#Profile">profile segments in response to HTTP requests.CacheableA data resource is said to be "cacheable"if the data resource contains a propertythat allows a sever to determine whether the cached resource matches arequest for a similar resource.CacheA storage area used by a server or proxy to storedata resources that have been retrieved orcreated in response to a request. When a new request for a "cached"href="#DataResource">data resource is received, the server orhref="#Proxy">proxy can respond with the cached version instead ofretrieving or creating a new copy.CapabilityAn attribute of a sender or receiver (oftenthe receiver) which indicates an ability togenerate or process a particular type of message content. See also "href="#Attributes">Attributes".Channel securityA form of security (href="#Authentication">authentication and/orhref="#Confidentiality">confidentiality) that operates on a givencommunication channel, regardless of the information that is transferredover that channel. The security thus provided isbetween the end-points of the channel only.ClientAn entity that is the original compositor of a CC/PPhref="#Profile">profile.ConfidentialityProtecting the content of a message from unauthorized disclosure.Content GenerationFor the purpose of this specification, "content generation" refers togenerating content appropriate to the useragent profile of the request by using thehref="#UserAgentProfile">user agent profile as input to ahref="#DynamicContent"> dynamic content generation engine. The XSLand style sheets of the document are used totailor the document to thehref="#UserAgentProfile">user agent profile of the request.Content NegotiationThe mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation whenservicing a request. The representation of entities in any response canbe negotiated (including error responses).Content SelectionFor the purpose of this specification, "content selection" refers toselecting an appropriate document from a list ofpossible choices or variants by matching thehref="#DocumentProfile">document profile with thehref="#UserAgentProfile">user agent profile of the request.Content ProviderA server that originates content in response to a request.Data ResourceA data object that can be transferred across a network. Data resourcesmay be available in multiple representations (e.g. multiple languages,data formats, size, resolutions) or vary in other ways.DocumentFor the purpose of this specification, "document" refers to contentsupplied in response to a request. Using this definition, a "document"may be a collection of smaller "documents", which in turn is a part of agreater "document".Document ProfileDocument profiles offer a means to characterize thehref="#Feature">features appropriate to given categories of useragents. For instance, one profile might includesupport for style sheets, vector graphics and scripting, while anothermight be restricted to the tags in HTML 3.2. Document profiles can beused by servers to select between documenthref="#Variant">variants developed for different user agentcategories. They can be used to determine what transformations to applywhen such variants are not available. Contentdevelopers can use document profiles to ensure that their web sites willbe rendered as intended.Dynamic ContentContent that is generated in response to a request. This may be usedfor content that depends on changing environmental factors such as time(e.g., stock quotes) or place (e.g., nearby gas stations)FeatureFunctional property of a device or entity.GatewaySoftware that is capable of bridging disparate network protocols. Forthe purposes of this specification, "gateway" refers to protocolbridging functionality, which may exist in a stand-alone gateway or maybe co-located with a proxy orhref="#OriginServer">origin server.HintA suggestion or preference for a particularoption. While this option is strongly recommended, its use is notrequired.IntegrityProcedures applied to ensure that information is not corrupted intransit. Different integrity procedures may protect against accidentalor intentional corruption of data.Machine UnderstandableData that is described with tags that associate a meaning to the data(i.e., an "author" tag would describe the author of thehref="#Document">document), allowing data to be searched or combinedand not just displayed.NamespaceA qualifier added to an XML tag to ensure uniqueness among XMLelements.Negotiate ContentMessage content that has been selected byhref="#ContentNegotiation">content negotiation.Negotiation MetadataInformation which is exchanged between the sender and thehref="#Receiver">receiver of a message byhref="#ContentNegotiation">content negotiation in order to determinethe variant which should be transferred.Non-repudiationThis term has been the subject of much dispute. Broadly speaking, itis a process that prevents a party to a communication from subsequentlydenying that the communication took place, or from denying the contentof the communication. Sometimes this term is used in a purely technicalsense (e.g. generation of data that is dependent on the communicationand its content) and sometimes in a legal sense (i.e. evidence thatcould be sustained in a court of law).Non-Repudiation of OriginThe ability of the receiver to verify thesource of the information.Non-Repudiation of ReceiptThe ability of the sender to verify that the intended recipientreceived the information.Non-variant ContentWhen the form/format of the content being sent does not depend onhref="#Receiver">receiver's capabilities and/orhref="#Preference">preferencesObject securityA form of security (href="#Authentication">authentication and/orhref="#Confidentiality">confidentiality) that operates on an item ofdata (a object), regardless of the communication channel over which itis passed. Object security can apply to data that is passed over severaldifferent data channels in succession, but cannot be used to protectmessage addressing and other transfer-related information.Origin ServerSoftware that can respond to requests by delivering appropriatecontent or error messages. The origin server may receive requests viaeither WSP or HTTP. Application programs executing on the origin serverdeliver content that is tailored in accordance with the CC/PP that canbe found within the provided profile. For thepurpose of this specification, "origin server" refers tohref="#ContentGeneration">content generation capabilities, which mayphysically exist in a stand-alone Web server or may be co-located with aproxy or gateway.PreferenceAn attribute of a sender or receiver (oftenthe receiver) which indicates a preference togenerate or process one particular type of message content over another,even if both are possible.PrivacyPreventing the unintended or unauthorized disclosure of informationabout a person. Such information may be contained within a message, butmay also be inferred from patterns of communication; e.g. whencommunications happen, the types of resource accessed, the partieswithwhom communication occurs, etc.ProfileAn instance of the schema that describecapabilities for a specific device and network. A profile need not haveall the attributes identified in thehref="#Vocabulary">vocabulary/schema.Proof of receipt, or Proof of deliveryInformation provided to the sender of a message that allows them toprove subsequently to a third party that the message was delivered toits intended recipient. (This proof may not necessarily be legallysustainable.)ProxySoftware that receives HTTP requests and forwards that request towardthe origin server (possibly by way of anupstream proxy) using HTTP. The proxy receives the response from thehref="#OriginServer">origin server and forwards it to the requestingclient. In providing its forwarding functions, the proxy may modifyeither the request or response or provide other value-added functions.For the purposes of this specification, "proxy" refers torequest/response forwarding functionality, which may exist in astand-alone HTTP proxy or may be co-located with ahref="#Gateway">gateway or origin server.RDF ResourceAn object or element being described by RDF expressions is a resource.An RDF resource is identified by a URI.ReceiverA system component (device or program) which receives a message.Receiver-initiatedTransmissionA message transmission which is requested by the eventualhref="#Receiver">receiver of the message. Sometimes described as"pull" messaging. E.g. an HTTP GET operation.SchemaAn RDF schema denotes resources which constitute the particularunchanging versions of an RDF vocabulary atany point in time. It is used to provide semantic information (such asorganization and relationship) about the interpretation of thestatements in an RDF data model. It does not include the valuesassociated with the attributes.SecurityDescribes a set of procedures applied to data communications to ensurethat information is transferred exactly as the sender andhref="#Receiver">receiver intend, and in no other way. Securitygenerally breaks down into integrity,href="#Authentication">authentication,href="#Confidentiality">confidentiality andhref="#Privacy">Privacy.SenderA system component (device or program) which transmits a message.Sender-initiatedtransmissionA message transmission which is invoked by the sender of the message.Sometimes described as "push" messaging. E.g. sending an email.UserAn individual or group of individuals acting as a single entity. Theuser is further qualified as an entity who uses a device to requestcontent and/or resource from a server.User agentA program, such as a browser, running on the device that acts on ahref="#User">user's behalf. Users may usedifferent user agents at different times.User Agent ProfileCapabilities and preference Informationpertaining to the capabilities of the device, the operating and networkenvironment, and users personalhref="#Preference">preferences for receiving content and/orresource.VariantOne of several possible representations of ahref="#DataResource">data resource.Variant ContentWhen the form/format of the content being sent depends onhref="#Receiver">receiver's capabilities and/orhref="#Preference">preferencesVocabularyA collection of attributes that adequately describe the CC/PP. Avocabulary is associated with a schema.2.
