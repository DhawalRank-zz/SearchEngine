Examples for such verticalapplications that have contact with W3C on different levels arehealth care and life sciences, social spaces, digital libraries,financial services, oil & gas exploration, or e-Government.What are Vertical Applications Used For?Apart from the inherent advantages for a particular vertical applicationarea to get a better familiarity with a particular W3C technology, thesegroups also provide valuable feedbacks on the technologies themselves.Vertical applications may bring forward specific and sometimeshighly non-trivial use cases, requirements in terms of, say,the expressivity of vocabulary orquery languages,efficiency considerations for inferences, etc.Work on the second generations of languages like OWL2 or SPARQL1.1, or thework on R2RML, has been greatly motivatedby the feedbacks provided by these vertical applications.ExamplesA good example is theThe Health Care and Life Science Interest Group.It has been set up, in 2005, to explore the usability of Semantic Web technologiesin area like drug discovery, patient care management and reporting, publicationof scientific knowledge, drug approval procedures, etc. The group has producedseveral demonstrations, publications, organized workshops and conferences, andhas succeeded in turning this particular application area into one of the mostactive user communities of Semantic Web technologies. Most major drug researchcompanies, university labs andresearch center working in the area, and specialized tool providersparticipated in this work. The feedbacks providedby this group was also significant for Semantic Web technologies; as an example thedefinition of some of the OWL2 Profiles was strongly influenced bythe ontologies and vocabularies developed by this community.Learn MoreThe Semantic Web community maintains a list of bookson a W3C Wiki page. Some of those booksare introductory in nature while others are conference proceedings ortextbook that address more advanced topics.Details of recent and upcomingSemantic Web related talks, given by the W3C Staff,the staff of the W3C Offices,and members of the W3C Working Groups are available separately; the slidesare usually publicly available. TheW3C also maintains a collection of SemanticWeb Case Studies and Use Cases thatshow how Semantic Web technologies, including different vertical application areas, is used inpractice.Current Status of SpecificationsLearn more about the current status of specifications relatedto:Health Care and Life Sciences (Semantic Web)eGovernmentThese W3C Groups areworking on the related specifications:Government Linked Data Working GroupSemantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences Interest GroupCurrent StatusHealth Care and Life Sciences (Semantic Web)eGovernmentUse ItTutorialsBusiness CaseSoftwareFooter NavigationNavigationHomeStandardsParticipateMembershipAbout W3CContact W3CContactHelp and FAQSponsor / DonateSite MapFeedbackW3C UpdatesCopyright  2013 W3C  (MIT, ERCIM,Keio, Beihang) Usage policiesapply.////]]>
